When k = 100, the class of rugby players have been broken into two clusters (11 and 72).
Same goes for soccer (football) players (clusters 6, 21, 40, and 87),
although some may like the benefit of having a separate category for Australian Football League.
The class of baseball players have been also broken into two clusters (18 and 95).

Quiz Questions:
1. The clustering objective (heterogeneity) is non-increasing for this example: True.

2. If the clustering objective (heterogeneity) would ever increase when running k-means, that would indicate THERE IS A BUG IN THE K-MEANS CODE.

3. Cluster #2 contains the greatest number of data points.

4. The size of the largest cluster across multiple runs using random initialization are:
   [18047, 15779, 18132, 17900, 17582, 16969, 16481]
   The minimum value is 15779. The maximum value is 18132.

5. When k = 10: Cluster 0 contains the greatest number of articles. Cluster 9 contains the least number of articles.

6. When k = 100, there are 35 clusters have fewer than 236 articles, i.e. 0.4% of the dataset.
