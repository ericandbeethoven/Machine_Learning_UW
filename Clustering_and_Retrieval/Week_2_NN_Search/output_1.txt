There is a known bug in pandas 0.18.x that causes justification broken on header line
when printing DataFrame using df.to_string(index=False) method.
See https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/13032 for detail.

The header lines in this report might look broken in the report.
Will be fixed when new versions of Pandas releases.

Part 4: Problem with cosine distances: Tweets vs. long articles
Sample Tweet: Democratic governments control law in response to popular act.

The cosine distance between Obama's article and the tweet is 7.059184e-01.

With cosine distances, the tweet is "nearer" to Barack Obama.
Ignoring article lengths completely resulted in nonsensical results.
In practice, it is common to enforce maximum or minimum document lengths.
