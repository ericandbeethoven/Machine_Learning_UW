# Machine Learning Specializtion - University of Washington
Coursera Page: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning

This repo includes the assignments of the specializtion. It will be updated as I go through the course.

All assignments are implemented in **Python 3.5**, with **Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib**.

**Output results are in files in the format *output.txt*.** It includes important outputs of algorithms, as well as answers to assignment quiz questions.

Set `PLOT_FLAG = True` to see plots in assignments. 

I did not purchase the course so I could not check my answers. Please submit an issue if there is something wrong with my solution.
